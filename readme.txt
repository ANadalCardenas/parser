# Parser Project

This project is a Python-based text parser designed to process and analyze sentences stored in text files. It provides functionality to read, parse, and potentially manipulate or extract information from these files.

## Project Structure

- `parser.py`: Main Python script containing the parsing logic.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for the project.
- `sentences/`: Directory containing text files (`1.txt`, `2.txt`, ..., `10.txt`) with sentences to be parsed.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and usage instructions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Install dependencies using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Usage
Run the parser script:
```bash
python parser.py
```

## Features
- Reads sentence files from the `sentences/` directory.
- Parses and processes text data.
- Easily extensible for additional parsing features.
